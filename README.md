# Vinyl Gallery

## Proposal

As vinyl records have been gaining popularity among music lovers around the world, in 2021, vinyl sales have outpaced CD
sales in the United States for the first time since the 1980s. Since vinyls are physical records occupying a lot of
space, it is a tough task for collectors to visualize their galleries and keep their gallery organized. Therefore, Vinyl
Gallery is proposed as a tool for **vinyl collectors** to achieve these goals with *simple steps* and *no cost*.

## User Stories

**Here are 4 user stories which will be realized by Vinyl Gallery in phase 1:**

- As a user, I want to be able to add one or more new vinyls to my gallery;
- As a user, I want to be able to delete one or more existing vinyl in my gallery;
- As a user, I want to be able to modify any information of any vinyl in my gallery;
- As a user, I want to be able to view all vinyls in my gallery.

**Here are 4 user stories which will be realized by Vinyl Gallery in phase 2:**

- As a user, I want to be able to save my gallery to file;
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my gallery from file.

## Phase 4: Task 3
Upon reflection on the design presented in my UML class diagram, if I had more time to work on the project, I would make
the following refactoring to improve your design:

- Design an abstract class called RunTime and two subclass call ConsoleRunTime and GUIRunTime to let my application run
in different modes independently with a reduced amount of codes;
- Design some exceptions to handle the scenarios where the inputs need to be checked if they are valid or not.
